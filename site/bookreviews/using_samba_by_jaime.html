'Using Samba' can be seen as THE fundamental book for Samba administrators. 
It covers the download, installation and configuration of the server. You will find instructions for Windows 95/98, 
NT and Linux. It goes on a step by step trip over disks shares, users 
securities and printer sharing.
<p>
From my point of view, the 40 or so pages dedicated to troubleshooting are 
worth the whole book. 
<p>
Installing and configuring Samba has become a somehow simple task, specially 
considering high level administrative interfaces like SWAT or Webmin. However, 
when it comes the time for troubleshooting, most of the times, you are alone.
'Using Samba' gives you the right support for this difficult task, with a simple 
and complete step-by-step guide for finding the source of the problem and ideas 
for solving it.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1 introduces Samba and shows what the software package can do for your network. 
<li>Chapter 2 demonstrates downloading, installing, and testing Samba on a UNIX system. 
<li>Chapter 3 contains instructions for configuring some Windows clients to use Samba. 
<li>Chapter 4 has the basic options for configuring disk shares in Samba are explored. 
<li>Chapter 5 covers browsing, filesystem differences and file permissions on Windows and Unix.
<li>Chapter 6 examines Samba security features like users, groups, and passwords. 
<li>Chapter 7 documents printing and name resolution with Samba. 
<li>Chapter 8 contains additional Samba information mainly for programmers. 
<li>Chapter 9 presents Samba troubleshooting ideas and resources. 
<li>Appendices describe SSL, performance tuning, commands, and Samba quick reference data.
</ul>
Though the book is starting to show its age (Windows XP is missing), it remains a 
useful guide for those looking to learn about resource sharing with Samba.
<p>
Even when you can download an HTML version of the book from <a href=http://samba.he.net/>http://samba.he.net/</a>, it is 
still worth to buy the book.
