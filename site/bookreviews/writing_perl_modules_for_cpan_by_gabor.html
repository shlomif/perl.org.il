When I first saw the title of the book I was not sure what can be
so special about writing Perl module for CPAN from just plain writing
modules that warrants a whole book. The simple tast of regitering and
PAUSE and then uploading your cipped module isn't such a difficult
task.
<p>
Then reading the book gave me a couple of answeres. This books is not 
for novices but it is not for the experts either. It is mainly for
those lone programmers who don't have a huge software engineering
background. They will learn a great deal about SE in general and


<p>
Sam Tregar, the author is not new to Perl or to CPAN. I have been
using  his HTML::Template module for ages already and I like it very
much so he must know a few things about the subject.
<p>
The book starts with the obvious question why to contribute to CPAN at 
all. Those who are reading this book probably have some reason already
so for them its is just reassuring their motives.<br>
Then it goes on with a light introduction to CPAN - its history, the
technology behind it, its structure and how to install modules that were
published on CPAN using the related CPAN.pm module or the ppm command.
<br>
Though it introduces the configuration of CPAN.pm it does not mention
how to save the new configration information.



Does not answer the question how to select but it is about writing anyway


17 explain when not to use the latest
23 suggest require in the wrong place
suddenly jumps to explain BEGIN with no real reason
does not explain the dangers in importing
then goet to packages

<p>
The second chapter is a good overview of module creation.


35 suggests Carp
44-destroy only called at exit?

Ch2
Some extreme programming in the back door
