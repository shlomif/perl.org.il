I have read this book in the last week.<p>
I really like 'learning' books; I have previously read 'Learning perl'. This time - just like before - it didn't cause me any dissapointment. 
<p>
The book explains very well almost all introduced topic. It brings very good examples (I loved the sailing skipper), which escort the reader as far as possiable. 
What I really liked in the book that it doesn't make any comparison with any other language.
<p>

The book does not open with 'hello world', but it does make an assumption of a normal level of knowledge in perl.

It brings a complex example of how to bring code from different files (eval, do, @INC, require)
<p>
The next chapter inroduces references to variables, arrays, hashes and explains how to dereference them.
Brings some examples of nested data-structures, reference-counting and anonymous objects.
Chapter 5 gives a clear picture of grep and map operators.<p>
Then it goes to subroutine references and callbacks.
It gives then good ideas on sort efficiency as well.
<p>
The next chapters are dedicated for the real OOP: objects, overriding methods, @ISA, data access in classes, inheritance and multiple inheritance. It uses the very classical animal example to explain classes, Setters, Getters, and object-distructors.
SUPER, UNIVERSAL and AUTOLOAD are some of the next topics.
<p>
Chapter 12 gives a deeper look into 'use', exporter and explains @EXPORT and @EXPORT_OK.
For those interested: the next chapters deal with distribution - how to create Makefile.pl's and make essential testing (Test), make install - packaging up a module for sharing, including portable installation instructions.
<p>
The last part of the book gives the reader some guidelines on how to publish modules at CPAN.<p>

You might find almost every topic of "Learning Perl Objects, References & Modules' in other Perl books as well. But this book really teaches the reader these very important techniques.
At the end of each chapter there are exercises related to the actual topics. I admit: I didn't do all of them, but the solutions are at the appendix.

It's a relatively quick overview of advanced perl topics (less than 200 pages). 
<p>In general I really recommend this book.
