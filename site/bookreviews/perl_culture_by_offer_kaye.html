I got a copy of this book in one of the Israel Perl Mongers meetings 
(<a href="http://www.perl.org.il/">www.perl.org.il</a>), to read and review it.
<p>
This book is a loose collection of articles from <a href="http://www.tpj.com/">The Perl Journal</a>, a magazine specializing in Perl. The book is titled as "Best of the Perl Journal", and I support this title- I enjoyed reading the entire book, which covers a variety of topics, from Science to Poetry.
<p>
Most O'Reilly titles are technical in nature, and at least for me those kinds of books are very hard to read from start to finish, as I quickly find entire chapters or even sections of the book irrelevant to my specific interest or simply written in a boring manner. Not so for "Games, Diversions and Perl Culture" - this light hearted book captivated me from the start,  even when reading articles about subjects which normally I wouldn't find interesting, such as Politics.
<p>
However, even though it is not a reference or hard-core technical book, "Games, Diversions and Perl Culture" still managed to teach me a lot of interesting Perl, with all code examples being clearly and thoroughly explained. I especially liked the "Obfuscated Perl" section, I promise you that any Perl programmer that really tries to understand the code in this section will either get an immense headache or will gain a huge leap forward in his understanding of this powerful language and how to get the most out of it (in as little characters as possible) ;-)
<p>
Since each article was written by an expert in that subject, "Games, Diversions and Perl Culture" has many articles but they are all of a high technical quality, something which would be impossible with a book with a single author who tried covering such a large variety of subjects. At the same time, even though it was written by many authors, the editor, Jon Orwant, did a great job in creating a book with a consistent feel and a generally high quality of writing.
<p>
Most book reviews would at this stage stop being general and start going into specifics, but "Games, Diversions and Perl Culture" covers such a wide range of topics and does this so well that I really feel I would be wasting your time. Go to the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/tpj3/">book's site</a>, download and read the sample chapters, peruse the table of contents and decide for yourselves whether you like it or not. If you're still hesitant at buying the book outright, I recommend trying out <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">Safari Bookshelf</a>, an electronic reference library which will, for a low price, let you read this and other books online, without having to pay the full price of a book.
