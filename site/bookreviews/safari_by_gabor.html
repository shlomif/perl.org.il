   <h1>A Safari Review</h1>
   Written by <a href="https://szabgab.com/">Gabor Szabo</a>, organizer of 
   the <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/">Israeli Perl Mongers</a> and founder 
   and CEO of <a href="https://szabgab.com/">Perl Technologies Israel</a>.<br /> 
   With help from Offer Kaye.<br />
   Date: 2004 March 21.<br /> 
   
   <h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
   The O'Reilly <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">Safari Bookshelf</a> calls
   itself "the premier electronic reference library for programmers and IT 
   professionals." Basically that means that it provides a way to read technical 
   books online, for a fee.<br />
   
   In the beginning of February 2004 I got a free entry valid for one year to the 
   O'Reilly Safari Bookshelf, with the requirement that within two months I'll 
   write a review of it and send it to my local Perl User Group. Now that the 
   second month is nearing its end it is time to keep my end of the bargain and 
   write the review.<br />
   
   I'm usually suspicious of people praising things they got for free, but after 
   thinking about it for a while I decided that I could write the review with a 
   clear conscience for two reasons:
   <ol>
      <li> If I didn't really like the service I certainly wouldn't go through 
      the effort of sitting down and writing this review only to get <em>another</em>
      free 10 months of the same service.</li>
      <li> This review isn't all that favourable. I'll just have to wait and see 
      how that goes over with the veterinarians at Safari of 
      <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>. Hopefully they will understand 
      that I am offering some constructive critiscism.</li>
   </ol>

   <h2><a name="exec">Executive Overview</a></h2>
   In general I think this is a good service that I'll use even after my free 
   subscription ends. I can look into a lot more books than I'd be able to do 
   without this service, and the cost is a real bargain.<br />
   
   I am not sure how this view would change if I lived in a place with a large 
   computer bookshop near-by where I could sit down and flip through actual books, 
   but where I live now there is no such option.<br />

   Once I get over the need to own the dead-tree version of a book and if I 
   have a way to read these books on my computer in a convenient way than it 
   seems it is more economic to use the Safari service than to buy a bunch of 
   paper books.<br />

   I'd certainly recommend to try out the free trial period to see if you can get 
   along with the change in the way how you read books.

   <h2><a name="details">Details</a></h2>
   The advantages of having access to on-line, high quality technical 
   references should be obvious to everyone and so I won't list them 
   here. However, how well the material can be used does depend very much on 
   the specific implementation/interface, which in the case of Safari 
   mostly got the job done but with several annoyances which I will list 
   below.<br />

   I will however give one "case study" which highlights a major benifit of 
   Safari:<br />
   
   As it turns out, several days after receiving my Safari account I had  
   to prepare an emergency presentation that I had to give within two 
   days. In cases like this I would have gone in the past to my real books 
   and browse them for the information, or I would have run 
   searches on various search engines to find answers to my questions and to 
   find examples. Using Safari, however, turned out to be a lot simpler, 
   and it allowed me to finish my presentation on time.<br />

   Using Safari also gives you a feeling (and I have 
   not tried to prove it) that the material which made it into the books is 
   of higher quality on average than what you find on various web site. Of 
   course I guess actually it all depends on the author and not so much on the 
   media.<br />
   
   Now for my actual observations:
   <ol>
      <li> The site looks very nice, seems to be fully browser independent 
      even with all the JavaScripts in it.</li>

      <li> In order to add books <strong>I had to enable pop-up windows
      </strong>. I don't like this and I don't see the reason behind it. 
      (Adding a bookmark also has an intermediate page and that does not 
      require a pop-up.) As by default I disabled all pop-ups in my browser it 
      took me quite a while to find out what is the problem, why I can not add 
      any books to my bookshelf.<br />
      This was really annoying</li>

      <li> <strong>Searches</strong><br />
      I don't think the search facility works well. For example, searching for:
	 <ol>
	    <li> "HTTP" -- returns "Integrating Linux and Windows", "Oracle &amp;  
	    Open Source", "Maximum Security", etc. I guess all of them 
	    mention http somewhere but they were not relevant to me at all.</li>
	    <li> "HTTP protocol" -- worked much better (The results were more relevant).</li>
	    <li> "http protocol perl" -- gave two Java books and an Informix 
	    book in the first 6 hits. Didn't I say I want to learn the http 
	    protocol as it is related to Perl? </li>
	 </ol></li>

      <li> On one hand after searching, when I click on a book I can still 
      click on a link that takes me back to my search results. On the other 
      hand after adding a bookmark to this book I can no longer get back to 
      the search results. So how can I then <strong>easily</strong> go over a 
      bunch of books and mark them? I think I should be able even after 
      bookmarking a page to return to my search results.<br />

      It would be nice if on the search results page I already had a way to 
      somehow select a book and put it in a temporary list of interesting 
      books. E.g. to put a bookmark "light" on the book.<br />

      OK, here is the way <strong>I</strong> started to use Safari. I might be 
      alone with this or there might be better ways to accomplish this.
	 <ol>
	    <li> Run a search, go over the titles and mark those books that 
	    seem to be interesting (using bookmarks). Sometimes I need to look 
	    at the TOC in order to decide if this is an interesting book but 
	    in most of the cases it is enough to see the title and the author 
	    so the search results page already contains enough information to 
	    decide if I would like to add this to my "pre-bookshelf" list.</li> 
	    <li> Do the previous step again for several search terms. </li> 
	    <li> Go over my "pre-bookshelf" bookmarks and select some of the 
	    books to be added to my Bookshelf.</li> 
	 </ol>
      It would be nice if I could do the above faster and with less clicks.</li>

      <li><strong>Categories</strong><br />
      On the left hand side of the screen there is a category tree of all the 
      books. This worked for me better than the search facility.</li>

      <li> Lately I try to work as much as possible off-line so it would 
      be good if I could download some of the books. As I can see it is 
      possible to download full chapters of books in the <strong>"Max Safari"
      </strong> package which is a bit more expensive and I can buy additional 
      download tokens. I don't know how it really works as it seems my free 
      account does not include this option. Actually I am not sure how much 
      I would use this. Once I bought a downloadable version of the 
      <a href="http://www.manning.com/conway">OOP book of Damian Conway</a> 
      and then hardly looked at the pdf version. I preferred to buy the one 
      in the traditional binding.</li>

      <li> Some good publishers such as <a href="http://www.manning.com/">
      Manning</a> and <a href="http://www.apress.com/">Apress</a> are missing 
      from the list. This is a pity as I like their books too.</li>

      <li> It would be nice if I could see a list of all the books in one 
      series such as the XP books of <a href="http://www.aw-bc.com/">
      Addison-Wesley</a>. On the other hand I can't seem to find such listing 
      on the web site of AW either.</li>

      <li> There is a section for public notes but I could not find any public 
      notes. I thought it was there so I can read (or even search) the public 
      notes of other people. It seems it is either not used or has some 
      technical problems.</li>

      <li> Whenever I try to add a Bookmark it asks me if I really want to add 
      this bookmark. This is annoying. Why do I need this? Is this such an 
      expensive operation? Does it cost money at all? Is it irreversible? 
      I don't see why this confirmation step is necessary.</li>

      <li> A forum for readers to share experiences using Safari and help each 
      other and/or to recommend books based on requests would be a nice 
      add-on feature.</li>
   </ol>

   <h2><a name="pricing">Pricing</a></h2>
   (as of this writing)
   <ul>
      <li>Safari Basic 
	 <ul>
	    <li>5-slot bookshelf for 10 USD / month  (2 USD/book/month)</li>
	    <li>10-slot bookshelf for 15 USD / month (1.50 USD/book/month)</li>
	    <li>20-slot bookshelf for 25 USD / month (1.25 USD/book/month)</li>
	    <li>30-slot bookshelf for 30 USD / month (1 USD/book/month)</li>
	 </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Safari Max (including the ability to download chapters)
	 <ul>
	    <li>10-slots bookshelf for 20 USD/ month (2 USD/book/month)</li>
	    <li>20-slots bookshelf for 30 USD/ month (1.50 USD/book/month)</li>
	    <li>30-slots bookshelf for 35 USD/ month (1.17 USD/book/month)</li>
	 </ul>
      </li>
   </ul>
   In all the cases you can get further discounts with annual payment.

   <h2><a name="cust_serv">Customer Service</a></h2>
   I sent most of the above annoyances and questions to the O'Reilly Customer 
   Service and have not received a reply within 4 weeks. I wonder if the 
   situation is better for paying customers? Luckily these issues don't make 
   the books themselves less valuable.

   <h2><a name="convenience">Convenience</a></h2>
   I really prefer to read my books - even computer books - in all kinds of 
   positions, not necessarily sitting in front of my desk. You need a light 
   notebook with a large screen to be able to read the on-line books while 
   not sitting in the traditional office-like position.

   <h2><a name="economics">Economics</a></h2>
   This is no doubt a major selling point for Safari. The cover price of most 
   of the computer books I read is somewhere in the 30-40 USD range. In various 
   on-line book shops I can get up to 30-40% discount but then I still need to 
   pay shipping and probably local taxes. This might not apply to other 
   countries. So by the time I get the book I pay about the same price as the  
   cover price. This means that even if I have the smallest Safari 
   account (2 USD/book/month) I can have the book for 14-20 month in my 
   bookshelf continuously. Probably I'll swap the book out during this period 
   and I might take it back later. Thus I probably pay the full price of a 
   book within 20-40 month. By that time most of the computer books are 
   outdated and are either useless or have a new edition. It seems to be 
   much more economical to read them on Safari and buy only those that I 
   feel will have a longer shelf-life.

   <h2><a name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
   My literature teacher always told me a writing has to have a beginning, 
   a middle and a conclusion. So even though I've written an <a href="#exec">
   Executive Overview</a> I'll add a conclusion here.<br />
   <br />
   I think <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">Safari Bookshelf</a> is a 
   great idea. It provides a good service inspite of having quite a number 
   of small annoyances. You can have books at 2 USD/month or if you are a 
   real book junkie you can get them at 1 USD/month. With the current book 
   prices even if you never swap out books you can hold a book for 20-40 
   month. That's a good price. Go and get a 
   <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">two week free trial period</a>. 
   I think it is worth it.
