     If you are considering sponsoring the YAPC::Israel::2004 event please contact <a href="https://szabgab.com/">Gabor Szabo</a>.
     <p>
     YAPC is a grass root Perl conference that takes place once a year
     in North America and Europe. The association of the Israeli Perl Users have taken
     upon itself the task to organize similar conferences in Israel once a year.
     </p>
     <p>
     In May 2003 we held our first conference with about 100 participants. That was a 
     one-day event.
     We had several sponsors, you can see the list of <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/YAPC/2003/sponsors.html">sponsors of YAPC:::2003</a>.
     Their sponsorship included books, subscriptions to online services, 
     software licenses,  broadband Internet access to give away and cash to cover some of
     the expenses.
     </p>
     <p>
     In 2004 we are going to have a one-day event again on 25th Februray 2004.
     We are expecting between 100-200 participants, mostly from Israel.
     </p>
     <p> 
     <b>The credit we give to our sponsors:</b><br />
     <ul>
     <li> We mention the sponsors on our <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/">perl mailing list</a> 
          when they agree to give sponsorship and again later in our further communication.</li>
     <li> We mention them in e-mails sent to conference registrants several times before and
          after the conference.</li>
     <li> We display the logo they supply with a few words about what do they do 
          on <a href="/YAPC/2004/sponsors.html">our web site</a></li>
     <li> We put the logo they supply on the first internal page of the printed proceedings
          of the conference that we hand out to the participants.</li>
     <li> Each sponsor will be mentioned individually at the opening and the final assembly thanks
          while their logo will be displayed on the overhead projector.</li>
     <li> Sponsors may drop a little something in the Conference Bag, some marketing material or 
          better yet something that people might find useful.</li>
     <li> The sponsors will be mentioned in all our communication to journalist.</li>
     </ul>
     <b>What we <font color="red">don't</font> give in any case:</b>
     (and we had to reject some sponsors last year because their insisting on some of these)
     <ul>
     <li> Information about individual participants. (though we might say that there are people from
          X, Y or Z organization but no names or e-mails)</li>
     <li> Presentation time will be given strictly based on technical content and not because 
          some company is sponsoring us.</li>
     <li> Place to put large posters of your company.</li>
     </ul>

     <b>What are we expecting from the sponsors:</b>
     <ul>
       <li> We need cash ($500-$1000 / sponsor) 
            to spend on all kinds of expenses we have.
            (if you want we will display the amount you gave next to your name or we can keep it confidential. It is up to you.)</li>
       <li> You can finance some of our expenses directly. (E.g. you can print all our proceedings
            yourself as Mercury did last year.)
            (see examples for such items at the list of our <a href="/YAPC/2004/sponsors.html">sponsors</a>)</li>
       <li> You can give presents (relevant books, internet access, software license, etc.)
            that we will either give away as we did last year or we'll auction out as done in
            YAPC::EU at the end of the conference.</li>
     </ul>
     <b>Where does the money go ? Who handles it ?</b>
     </p>
     <p>
     The finances are handled by <a href="https://szabgab.com/">Perl Training Israel (PTI)</a>. 
     It will give invoice to the sponsors.</p><p>
     In case the expenses were higher than the total income PTI will cover the difference.</p><p>
     This is a non-profit conference. 
     If there is extra money left at the end of the conference we'll either keep it for the
     next YAPC::Israel conference or give it to <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a>.
     </p>
     <p>
     In 2003 our income and expenses were in balance.
     </p>
