The Second Perl Conference in Israel<br />
Organized by the<br />
<a href="http://www.perl.org.il/">Israeli Perl Mongers</a><br />
</h1>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>
The previous Perl conference in Israel, <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/YAPC/2003">YAPC::Israel::2003</a>, 
was highly successful, attracting more than 100 participants from all
over Israel and a few from abroad. The positive feedback which 
followed this successful one-day conference, and the growing 
importance of the Israeli Perl Mongers as a meeting place and forum 
for discussion for students, practitioners and researchers interested 
in the Perl programming language, have encouraged us to start to 
organize another conference for 2004, including regular 
length talks and longer tutorials.</p>

<h2>Call for Participation</h2>
<p>
The Perl programming language is widely used by thousands of 
practitioners for various purposes in the Israeli hi-tech 
industry, in research institutes and in many other places. 
Perl is a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, 
extracting information from those text files, and printing reports
based on that information. It's also a good language for many system 
management tasks. The language is intended to be practical (easy to
use, efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal). 
This extremely practical and flexible programming language has grown
to be more than yet another tool to get the job done - it has become a
practice which encourages large communities of users to group together for
mutual help in Perl related topics and for fun. The Israeli Perl mongers are
a good example for such a community.<br />
It is the aim of this conference to bring together practitioners, 
scholars, students, programmers, researchers and managers from
different areas to discuss their views on various aspects of the Perl
programming language, to share knowledge and to have fun while doing so.<br />
We therefore invite contributions from all fields on topics related
to Perl. The YAPC::Israel::2004 organizing committee invites proposals
for foundational, introductory, and advanced lectures, presentations and
lightning talks on a wide range of topics in the following (but not 
limited to) fields: </p>
<pre>
	Biotechnology
	Database Connectivity
	Embedding Perl
	Extending Perl
	Functional Programming
	Interoperability (CORBA, .NET, etc.)
	Network Programming
	Object Oriented Programming
	Perl 6
	Perl Success Stories
	Regular Expressions
	Server Programming
	System Administration
	Testing
	Tips and Tricks
	Verification
	Web Programming
</pre>


<h2>Conference Structure</h2>
<p>
This one day conference will include lectures (ranging in length from 5 to 90 minutes) and tutorials (up to 3 hours long).<br />
Types of lectures:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foundational</strong> lectures require no knowledge or very basic knowledge of Perl, and should be used for teaching Perl.</li>
<li><strong>Introductory</strong> lectures assume reasonable knowledge of Perl and should be aimed at the average Perl user.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced</strong> lectures assume good knowledge of Perl and/or good knowledge in the specific topic under discussion. They should be aimed at people who are fluent with Perl and want to learn something advanced (e.g. perl guts).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Tutorials should be longer and more in-depth than ordinary lectures, regardless of the level (foundational, introductory or advanced).
</p>

<h2>Location and Time</h2>
<p>
The conference date has been set to February 26, 2004. <br />
<a href="http://www.idc.ac.il/">The Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya</a> has kindly agreed to host the conference. For directions (in Hebrew) on how to get to the center and a map, see the center's <a href="http://www.idc.ac.il/heb/AboutIDC/tour/directions.asp">directions page<a/>.
