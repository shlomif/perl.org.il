<h1>YAPC::Israel::2006 Accessibility</h1>

<p>
On this conference we will try to provide facilities for people with disabilities.
The level of our support will depend on the number of people interested in it
and the availability of financing. <br />
For the first part, if you would like to attend the conference and you have
some disability that would normally keep you away, please contact 
<a href="mailto:w1@zak.co.il">Omer Zak</a>, the person responsible for
accessibility and discuss with him your needs. Later we will try to figure
out if we can fulfill those needs.
<br />
Regarding the financing part, if you know organization that would be ready
to help us finance the costs of this support, please let them contact
<a href="mailto:w1@zak.co.il">Omer Zak</a>.
