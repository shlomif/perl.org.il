<h2>What we have forgotten to write in the first place</h2>

<b>Do I need to submit my slides or detailed proposal before you accept my talk?</b>
<p>
Later in September we will setup a web site to submit your proposal.<br>
Then you'll still have a few days to submit a short abstract.<br>
Based on that and other factors we'll select the talks and sometime in October
decide on the talks.<br>
This will leave you with more than a month to actually prepare your presentation
and submit some material you will want us to include in the proceedings.
