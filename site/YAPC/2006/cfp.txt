YAPC::Israel::2006 - Call for Papers and Participation
--------------------------------------------------------

After three Perl conferences in Israel ( http://www.perl.org.il/YAPC/ ) 
it seems it is time to enlarge the conference and include other, related 
Open Source technologies as well.

In February 2006, we are going to have a 3 day long conference in 3 parallel
tracks covering various Open Source fields:
- Programming languages: Perl, Python, PHP, Tcl, Ruby, Haskell, ...
- Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, ...
- Version Control: Subversion, SVK, Arch, Darcs, ...

Other suggestions are welcome!

Autrijus Tang, Chief Pugs Hacker



Date and Location
-------------------
The conference will be held in February 2006 in Israel.
Exact dates and location will be announced soon.


Announcements
-------------
The best way to be up to date on the conference is to join our low volume
news mailing list at   http://www.perl.org.il/mailman/listinfo/news

- Speakers of talks 20 minutes or longer are invited to help cover
  the conference expenses by paying the participation fee but are 
  not required to so.


Tracks or Workshops
-------------------
This year we are planning to have several well defined tracks or workshops. 
Each track will contain tutorial-like presentations on both introductory and
advanced level. In addition we are planning to have "use cases", that is
people showing us case studies on how they use the given technology in
that field.

The major tracks we are interested are the following:

- Using P for web application development
- GUI development with P and Tk (or other Toolkit)
- Using P for testing
- How to write and maintain large applications in P?
- Embedding P (Featuring sample application that uses P in itself)
- Windows System Administration using P
- mod_perl
- P and databases
- OOP

- In addition we would like to see talks about new and intersting
  technologies such as Ruby on Rails or PyPy and fun with P

Replace P in the above sentences with your favorite programming language.

Other suggestions for tracks are welcome!

Beginners track
---------------
Last year the beginners track was a surprisingly successful one. 
This year we would like to repeat it. We would welcome the same
speakers with the same or improved version of their talks. In 
addition we would like to see new faces and new talks in the
beginners track.



Length
-------
20, 40, 60 min presentations
90, 180 min tutorials
5 min lightning talks

Language
----------
Hebrew or English



Hackaton 
---------
As Autrijus is going to stay in Israel a few weeks we are planning to 
provide him with a platform to hack on. For this after the conference
we are planning to go out to the wilderness for a few days with 
notebooks and an uplink to the world and do some Pugs hacking.

That is, the more adventures types can join this additional event.
We are goint to rent rooms in a "Zimmer" (B&B for the British) and move 
there for a long weekend.

This is a very good opportunity to get started with Perl6 or Haskell 
or both.

Exact details will be announced later. 
Expected cost for the hackathon is ~ 40 USD/night/person + food.


So what TODO now?
------------------
Start thinking now about your presentation, ask us questions
if something is not clear so we can have a full size conference
by February.
