The purpose of a poster is to outline a piece of work in a form that is easily 
assimilated and stimulates interest and discussion.

In preparing a poster, simplicity is the key. A typical reader may spend only a few 
minutes looking at the poster, so there should be a minimum of clutter and a maximum 
of pithy, informative statements and attractive, enlightening graphics. A poster 
should tell a story. A question-and-answer format, for example, may be 
appropriate for part of the poster. 

Poster Preparation Suggestions

* For your poster, a board will be provided which measures 1 mt wide by 1.20 mt tall. 
  The board is elevated on a stand.
* Time will be allowed for each presentation to be mounted on a poster board before
  the start of each poster session. It is advisable to bring push pins or velcro, 
  although a limited supply will be available. 
* The title of your poster should appear at the top in large letters. Poster titles 
  using a font size of about 60 point will stand out and be easy to read. The minimum 
  font size for poster titles should be 36 point. Below the title you may wish to put 
  the author(s)' name(s) and affiliation(s). 
* People will not read a lot of text, and certainly won't read standard journal-sized 
  text. Try to use an easy-to-read font and keep the font size of important points to 
  24 - 40 point if possible. The smallest text on your poster should be at least 18 
  point. 
* Studies show that text written in all capital letters is hard to follow; it is 
  better to use bold print than all caps, though you are then limited on making those 
  bold-type statements that will stand out from the rest of your text. 
* The flow of your poster should be from the top left to the bottom right. 
* You may wish to use color for highlighting and to make your poster more attractive. 
* Use pictures, diagrams, cartoons, figures, etc., rather than text wherever possible. 
  Use of color in your graphics will enhance your poster.
* Try to state your main result in large lettering. This way people can read the 
  poster from a distance. 
* Many poster presentations are pre-mounted on poster or art board; white paper on 
  black or colored stock will allow your poster to stand out and present a more 
  finished look. 
* Your poster should cover the key points of your work. It need not attempt to include 
  all the details; you can describe them to people who are interested. The ideal poster 
  is designed to attract attention, provide a brief overview of your work, and 
  initiate discussion. 
* Make your poster as self-explanatory as possible. This will save your efforts for 
  technical discussions. 
* You may wish to prepare a short presentation of about 5 or 10 minutes that you can 
  periodically give to those assembled around your poster. You may give this talk 
  several times during your poster session. 
* Timely collection of materials at the end of the session is your responsibility.
