The main fuel of volunteers - both as speakers and as organizers - 
is the feedback. In order to thank those people all the effort we
need to make sure we actually provide them with feedback. Good or bad.
Whatever. This is important to the speakers and organizers of this event 
and maybe even more important to the speakers, organizers and participants 
of next year's event. This is the way to see, it is worth the effort.
<p>

There are at least 2 ways to provide feedback:
<ul>
<li> On the main Israel.pm mailing list (perl@perl.org.il) if you
   are already registered. If not, you can register here:
   <a href="http://mail.perl.org.il/mailman/listinfo/perl">Israel Perl Mongers mailing list</a>
   </li>
   
<li> Directly to the <a href="organizers.html">organizers</a>
   If you prefer to send it directly to one of us, you are welcome. Please note
   in your message if we can publish what you wrote (and you are sending
   it to one of us only because it is more convenent) or if you'd like to
   keep it private.
   </li>
</ul>

<h2>By Felix Liberman</h2>
<p>
On Feb 17th I attended Israel Perl Conference (or more accurate
YAPC::Israel::2005). By sharing my impressions I hope to help persons
who missed this forum.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.perl.org.il/YAPC/2005">YAPC::Israel::2005</a> stands for "Yet Another Perl
Conference". It was a 3rd conference in our region and (as previous
years) took place at <a href="http://www.idc.ac.il/">Interdisciplinary Center Herzeliya</a>.
</p>
<p>
Among participants there were big companies representatives (including
IEC guys from Intel), but it's not an obligatory to represent some
company (myself is a good example) -- participation fee is moderate
and in most cases (if it's relevant) covered by your employer. If you
interesting to visit this forum next year - surf
<a href="http://perl.org.il/YAPC">YAPC::Israel</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
After short opening talks we spread into different tracks (including
one for Perl beginners), while my choice was natural -  "Revision
Control Systems", since it was my job mainstream during last 7 years.
The presenter gave short review on Revision Control tools history and
compared existing Open Source solutions. Although some statements
about lack of functionality in "old good" CVS were slightly
exaggerated (IMHO), the practical solutions that could give
"Arch-Magic" tool impressed the audience (and myself too). Next
presentation of my choice has very cool topic: "Something About
Parrot". We got
interesting update about Perl-6 project status and role of Parrot
environment in next generation programming languages. Now all rumors
about Perl future became much more clear.
Next presentation was devoted to web-services, and since for myself
it's almost unknown field I learned interesting things about data
exchange technologies. Appears that Web Services implementation in
Perl using SOAP gave to web programmer very flexible solutions for
wide spectrum of tasks: from automatic translation to financial
calculations.
</p>
<p>
After lunch I returned to "Perl for experienced" track. I always
considered joint Perl and C (or other languages) application as exotic
trick that require special knowledges and lots of experience. But
"Introduction to XS" lecture helped to dispel this myth. C-language
add-on development technology presented there as a set of
well-documented steps that does not require hacker's degree.
</p>
<p>
The last two lectures I attended were from "beginners track". It was
great impression to see how many people were interested in Perl
basics. Even here I found something new - how to  compare files using
MD5 checksum (once somebody asked me about similar problem and I
borrowed the checksum solution from Perl newsgroup archive).
</p>
<p>
Trying to sum-up impression from YAPC::Israel::2005 I want to
emphasize high level of presented papers and non-declining attention
to Perl from programmers and managers side. My recommendation to all
Perl professionals and beginners - we must meet more and exchange our
knowledges.
