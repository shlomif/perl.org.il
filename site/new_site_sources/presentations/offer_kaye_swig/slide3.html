<title>In the beginning</title>
<p>
We begun with a nice implementation in ANSI-C of a complex data structure called a "Suffix Tree" (See [2] for a concise definition or [3] for much more info).
<p>
We knew people on the web were looking for such an implementation, but in Perl.
<p>
Why in Perl, you ask? Because writing C code, as we all know, is loads of fun, but writing Perl is just, well, even more fun :-)
