Tasks by Subject:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Meeting Pages
-------------
* On the new meeting pages maybe we could add on the side bar a list of all the meeting so I won't
  have to keep pressing back to get to the next or previous meeting. In addition
  you can expand the list at the current date to show the Agenda and Report links....

* Add a list of presentations with links to the meeting page when the presentation was given


Library and Book Pages
----------------------
* Get cover images for all books, add image name to books hash and place the image in the books/images dir.

* Add some text about each book from the publisher site or Amazon site
  to the individual book pages.

* Maybe register with Amazon to get credits and then buy more books with those credits ?

* Update scripts so that books.pl runs only if data sources for individual book pages change
  (most likely BooksData.pm and books.pl itself, perhaps images also?).
  Looks like we need 'make' or something similiar?
  Reason- this part of the process is getting heavy, so it would be better if it were not run
  every time.


YAPC
----
* What about YAPC pages?

* Go over stuff from old site and make sure all important info/material/files etc. have
  been integrated/copied into the new site.

* add back the link to YAPC/2004 as Gabor left it out when united the meetings data

MISC page
---------
* Maybe create a script to fetch the list of modules for a list of PAUSEDs + some added manually
  so we don't need to constantly update the module list, we can  add single modules of other
  people (Hebrew, Passover etc.) + we don't remove modules of SCHOP even though they are already
  maintained by someone else.

* for the who uses perl part add categories (see the PTA site for example)
  sortable table ?
  maybe add some further text for each company with some details and some short story of what are
  they using Perl for


Others
------
* RSS feed of our future events - for this we need to put at least the future event is some
  structure. (share with IGLU and the rest of the sites)

* improve README to include howto items
  and once we have them make sure every information exists only once
  (e.g. right now when adding a new meeting we have to update in 3 files and
  each file in more than one location (dates).
  I know it was like this in my system as well but it is time we fix it and generate the
  rest of the pieces.


Hebrew
-------
* Enable the Hebrew pages



Meeting
--------
- check the response values of the system calls
- use internal calls instead of system calls
- check what happens if one of the scripts fails (e.g. dies)
- BooksData arrays (details) should be hash
- move data from Perl hash to plain text file
  (maybe remove HTML from the data)
- change the "database" so the isbn will be the main key of the hash
