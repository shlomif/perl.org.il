        We don't have anything on our agenda yet but I guess I'll bring a few books along so you
        can have a look and decide if it is worth buying. Reuven Lerner will bring along his own book
        <a href="http://www.coreperl.com/">Core Perl</a> but we won't sell books.<br />
        I can also bring my notebook with the CPAN mirror on it :-).<br />
        Basically we would like to see each other and try to find a way to increase the (positive) awareness
        of Perl in Israel.<br />
        If someone has special request of items that s/he would like to hear about let me know asap so
        we can discuss if we can make it happen this time.

             <p>
             Some of the Perl Mongers sites have all kinds of people who can write nice articles about
             what happened on the meeting, we are not among them.
             <br /><br />
             Anyway a total of 6 people showed up on the first Perl Mongers meeting in Azrieli.pm.
             This a bit less than what I expected and less than the number of people who have confirmed :-(
             they'll come and even one less than the number of the dwarfs. There was no Snow-white either.
             <br /><br />
             So we were sitting at a table and we had peer-to-peer (*) conversation about Perl issues,
             Linux and Open Source in general. We talked about Richard Stallman, Perl Whirl,
             what each one of us is doing, how to find duplicates in code using DNA analysis, who
             can write a compiler that creates Perl script from another language, etc.<br />
             We talked a bit about Israeli companies that are already using Perl as an "official"
             programming language and that there seem to be a growing need for Perl in Israel.
             Now we only need to increase that need and raise awareness of Perl.
             <br /><br />
             We agreed (I think :-) that we should meet again and organize some lecture(s) for
             the next meeting. We need to promote Perl (anyone knows a PR company that would be
             interested doing it for the fun ?) and we should make a list of companies supporting
             Perl in Israel (<a href="/misc.html#who_uses_perl">here is the start of it</a>). The next day I noticed
             that the number of registrations on the <a href="http://mail.perl.org.il/mailman/listinfo/perl/">mailing list</a> has
             increased more that the number of participants of the meeting. That's good.
             <br /><br />
             The food was quite expensive, another reason to find another place where we can have some
             cheaper solution.
             <br /><br />
             Next meeting will take place... see announcements later.
             <br /><br />
             (*) One peer was talking and other peer(s) were listening :-)

             <p>
             A total of 11 people came to the meeting nearly twice the number of the
             previous meeting. This is great.<br /><br />
             We went together with Reuven and missed the exit from the highway in
             Tel Aviv twice because we ware talking about Perl.
             Anyway we got there a bit after 18:00<br />
             Some people were already waiting there though most of the were local
             to Raz. As more people joined us we talked about how they use Linux on
             their printer photo-copier in Raz (I think, though I am not sure I
             understood that :)<br />
             <br />
             We talked about MS and BSA and that some of us have received warnings that
             they will come to check our systems for Applications without licenses.
             Sure. Most of use Linux anyway but this triggered us to talk about a
             few applications like Power Point that has no Open counterpart that
             works in Hebrew as well. Oded showed us what he is using.<br />
             <br />
             Personally I think that all the frightening ads the BSA shows lately is
             a huge opportunity to anyone selling Linux as the solution.
             I think the BSA generates the right amount of fear that can be
             resolved by some Open Source software with its license.<br />
             <br />
             We also talked about the difference between an MS programmer whose
             world is the Visual Studio and the Unix style programmer who can work
             with any editor and compiler. Personally I think that the fact that
             VS provides such an easy way to program does not necessarily create
             bad programmer but sure, it does not force you to have full
             understanding of a lot of underlying issue. The question remaining is
             weather it is important ?
             <br /><br />
             Then a bit after 19:00 Reuven started his <strong>lecture</strong>
             <br /><br />
             Actually this was the first time I heard Reuven give a real lecture
             and I liked very much his style. He gave us an introduction and
             history of representing letters in computers then moved on to
             the various unicode definitions - the 2-byte version of Microsoft
             and the variable length version of the Unicode consortium.<br />
             Finally he talked about how the whole thing is implemented in Perl
             5.8 that should be released in the near future.
             <br /><br />
             You can see <a href="http://reuven.lerner.co.il/talks/unicode/start">his slides</a> as well.
             <br /><br />
             After the lecture we kept talking a bit and there were two
             volunteers already to give talk on the coming meetings. We are going
             to schedule them soon.

             <p>
             I am writing this nearly two month after the meeting took place
             as I
             was very busy after the meeting and went to a holiday in most of
             August. Actually during the holiday I was active organizing
             the first <a href="http://www.perl.org.hu/">Perl meeting in Budapest</a>.
             </p>

             <p>
             As you might have read in the mailing list, since the last meeting
             Ariel Brosh has suddenly passed away. I knew him from the first perl
             meeting and he also participated in this one on July 11 where he
             explained things about the HTML::Merge package in what he was very
             deeply involved. He was one of the most active Perl developers in
             Israel. See the <a href="/misc.html#projects">projects</a> page for his projects.
             </p>

             <p>
             Now back to the meeting as much as I can remember. Actually I'd be
             glad if other participants also wrote about the meetings and it
             would not be depending only on my schedule.
             </p>

             <p>
             Before the 'official talk' among other things we mentioned fun ways to
             frighten C programmers with statements like
             </p>

             <p>
             <code>$a++ unless $a&gt;3;</code>
             </p>

             <p>
             I asked about a possibility to compare solutions in various
             languages. Shlomi (I think it was him) pointed me to
             <a href="http://www.bagley.org/~doug/shootout/">The Great Computer
             Language Shootout</a> where some 30 programming languages are
             being compared. It is interesting but I am thinking about something
             different more for educational purposes. I think about a site where
             you can find programming problems at various levels solved in a number
             of languages with an explanation about the solution and the
             language. For certain languages there might be more than one solution
             but it is not a requirement. Speed would not be important. It would be
             a sort of multilingual Cookbook. There is another site that is a bit
             similar to what I am looking for:
             <a href="http://www.faqts.com/knowledge_base/index.phtml/fid/462">FAQTS</a>
             </p>

             <p>
             Roi from <a href="http://www.raz.co.il/">RAZ Information Systems</a>
             talked about HTML::Merge - the open source scripting tool they have
             developed.
             <br /><br />
             On <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rmerge/">Source forge</a>
             they give the following description:<br />
             <q>Merge is a Perl/HTML/SQL embedded scripting tool, user
             extendable, that works by compiling your pages to pure
             Perl. (HTML::Merge)</q>
