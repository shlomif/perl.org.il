This page is meant to help presenters organize laptops at YapcIsrael2004

For now, we'll make just the list of presentations and a list of available laptops.  Once the schedule is posted, we'll reorganize availability of laptops for specific timeslots.

If you /need/ a laptop, add which formats you'd like to have (in order of preference) on the laptop.

If you /have/ a laptop, add a * by your name and say which programs and which OS you have on-board.

== Desktops
Sorry no laptops here but we found out that in every lecure room in IDC there is a Windows PC. Most likely you'll have Internet connection and they seem to have a CD in each one. There is IE6.0 on them. My suggestions is to
0 send your slides to gabor@perl.org.il so he can put them on the web site
0 bring the slides on a floppy
0 bring the slides on a CD
so you have 3 options to retrieve your data

(What about USB for DiskOnKey ?)

Laptops can be connected to the projector but mine did not work

== Presentations with uncertain laptop requirements or availability ==
If your presentation doens't /need/ a laptop (eg, lightning talk), please remove it from this list

== Presentations that need laptops ==

LM-Solve - A Logic Mazes Solver
by: Shlomi Fish
- I'll need a laptop with a decent modern web-browser (that supports XHTML 1.0 and CSS well) and either an Internet connection, a CD-ROM drive or a floppy disk drive.

Introduction to the Template Toolkit
by: Shlomi Fish
- I'll need a laptop with either MS PowerPoint (XP is preferable but I think 97/2000 should do as well), or Open Office (1.1.x is preferable, but I think 1.0.x should do as well)

Making your objects smell funny
by: Yuval Kogman
(PDF or DVI viewer)
(I will be bringing a laptop, but it has no VGA output - old iBook, MacOSX 10.3. If people huddle, I don't mind anyone using it. It's got RJ45, USB and CD-ROM (no ext2 and derivs))

Harnessing the Power of the Web with Libwww-perl
by: Nadav Har'El - I don't have a laptop, and I'll need somehow to make a presentation. I'll probably want my presentation to be in OpenOffice format, most likely in English.

Bye Bye EEK - Improving design with the Aspect module
by: Ran Eilam

== Laptop slots ==
These slots will be filled with the specific laptops in a given room at a given time.

Non-presenters who already know which presentations they plan on being at should fill this in to give presenters who need a laptop a good idea of what will be available in that room.  Do *NOT* assume that just because a laptop is in your room means you can use it - that should be worked out with the laptop owner, and marked above if final.  Information here is meant to be a reference only (or to help arrange a backup if something happens to your arranged laptop)
