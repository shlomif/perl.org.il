This is the informal page organized as a result of the Jerusalem carpool group on Yapc2004Rides.

Here, we can pool info on rental rates and who's doing what.

YehudaBerlinger seems to be the driver, if we go (as only he voulenteered on Yapc2004Rides) but this is no guarantee

Car rental information (prices, deals, places, etc) should be pooled below.

* Hagar Rental: 150 NIS /day + 250 km for a small Fiat. Gas will likely be about 80 NIS. Total = 230 / 4 ~~ 60 pp

Ther is a problem, however. A car rental is for 24 hours. The rental place only opens at 8:30, so we would be lucky to get to the conference by 10:00, If we rent the night previous, we won't get it back in time before the rental place closes.
