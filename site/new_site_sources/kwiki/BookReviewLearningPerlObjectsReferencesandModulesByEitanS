I have read this book in the last week.

I really like 'learning' books; I have previously read 'Learning perl'. This time - just like before - it didn't cause me any dissapointment.

The book explains very well almost all introduced topic. It brings very good examples (I loved the sailing skipper), which escort the reader as far as possiable. What I really liked in the book that it doesn't make any comparison with any other language.

The book does not open with 'hello world', but it does make an assumption of a normal level of knowledge in perl. It brings a complex example of how to bring code from different files (eval, do, @INC, require)

The next chapter inroduces references to variables, arrays, hashes and explains how to dereference them. Brings some examples of nested data-structures, reference-counting and anonymous objects. Chapter 5 gives a clear picture of grep and map operators.

Then it goes to subroutine references and callbacks. It gives then good ideas on sort efficiency as well.

The next chapters are dedicated for the real OOP: objects, overriding methods, @ISA, data access in classes, inheritance and multiple inheritance. It uses the very classical animal example to explain classes, Setters, Getters, and object-distructors. SUPER, UNIVERSAL and AUTOLOAD are some of the next topics.

Chapter 12 gives a deeper look into 'use', exporter and explains @EXPORT and @EXPORT_OK. For those interested: the next chapters deal with distribution - how to create Makefile.pl's and make essential testing (Test), make install - packaging up a module for sharing, including portable installation instructions.

The last part of the book gives the reader some guidelines on how to publish modules at CPAN.

You might find almost every topic of "Learning Perl Objects, References & Modules' in other Perl books as well. But this book really teaches the reader these very important techniques. At the end of each chapter there are exercises related to the actual topics. I admit: I didn't do all of them, but the solutions are at the appendix. It's a relatively quick overview of advanced perl topics (less than 200 pages).

In general I really recommend this book.
