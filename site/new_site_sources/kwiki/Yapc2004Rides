This page is meant to organize rides (Carpools) to/from YapcIsrael2004.

Page is sorted by area.  If you need/have a ride, write your name (maybe pickup neighborhood?) and when you plan on leaving and coming back.  If you are coming by your own car, add a * next to your name.  If you are willing to split the rent of a car with other people, put an R next to your name; if you can be the driver of such a rented car, also put a D next to your name.
