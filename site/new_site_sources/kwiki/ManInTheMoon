= Why am I here?

Although I've not been living in Israel any time in my life (not enough craters to my liking although the next war may change it) I read the Israel.pm mailing list to collect information about you Terrans quite a lot, so I thought I'll also come to YAPC to meet some of you personally.

== BTW, I think you should know:
Since we don't have a lot of atmosphere on the moon sound does not travel very good there and my ears are weak. I plead you all to *SHOUT* when you are talking to me. Thanks.
