= The Israeli Perl Mongers

The [http://www.perl.org.il/ Israeli Perl Mongers] are a group of Perl enthusiasts who use Perl and perl for fun and profit. Most of them live in Israel. We are part of a large collection of independent Perl user groups called [The Perl Mongers http://www.pm.org]

Originally founded by Gaal Yahas, the group really took off when GaborSzabo created the www.perl.org.il site and started organizing monthly meetings. Gabor is now the un-official head of the group. /Update/: we have decided to make it official.

Our activities include:

* [http://www.perl.org.il/mailman/listinfo/perl A mailing list] dedicated to discussing Perl related topics. If you have a Perl question, the mongers will help you with expert advice. And there is no need to wear your flame-retardant suit.
* [http://www.perl.org.il/meeting.html Monthly meetings] in which we come to first mingle and then listen to interesting presentations. Look at some of our previous meetings to see the topics we have visited. After meetings we visit the *Godfather* bar for a drink.
* [http://www.perl.org.il/YAPC/ Conferences] - we hold an annual YAPC::Israel conference (where [=YAPC] stands for Yet Another Perl Conference)
