Who knows?

Hi.  I'm Issac Goldstand. You can email me at isaac at cpan doot org

I guess I'd be the [http://perl.apache.org mod_perl] hacker of our group.  Although, truth to be told, I haven't been working much in [http://perl.apache.org mod_perl] lately.  Using lots of [http://www.perl.com Perl] (CGI and shell stuff), [http://www.php.net PHP] (nooooooooo!) and doing some interaction.  (Maybe) I'll give a talk at the next YapcIsrael2004 about some of it :-)

You can see my presentation from YapcIsrael2003 [here http://www.beamartyr.net/YAPC/]

My presentation for YapcIsrael2004 will be here soon.

"Tell me, dad," said the  young man, taking a puff, "are there any marriageable young girls in this town? ".
The old caretaker did not show the least surprise.
"For  some a mare'd be a  bride," he  answered, readily  striking up a conversation.
"I have no more questions," said the young man quickly.
