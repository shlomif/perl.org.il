I first learned about this book when I encountered it
in [the Joel on Software recommended books list http://www.joelonsoftware.com/navLinks/fog0000000262.html]
. Afterwards, the lecturer of my Computer Graphics course used it in one of the first lectures to illustrate good user-interface design. This made it a book I very much liked to read.

To be honest, the book was ordered by accident from Amazon. But I was glad it came and so set down to read it. It is nothing short of excellent. Very fun to read and very enlightening.

Donald Norman gives many examples of good and bad design in everyday objects to illustrate the concepts and how-to's of good design. While Norman focuses mostly on everyday objects, the theory he proposes can be implemented for computer programs as well, and so is very important for programmers as well.

Anyone who designs systems for everyday use will benefit from this book, and I believe most people will very much enjoy reading it. Highly recommended.
