    I took a cab to the meeting and arrived early. I soon met Ran (who works
    there) and Shmuel. We talked about work, testing, life and stuff. It turns
    out Yuval Yaari and other people arrived even sooner, and were at the kitchen.
    Gabor also arrived carrying a box of T-shirts, and then went out to buy
    food. Then the meeting was supposed to start.
    </p>

    <p>
    "Supposed" is the keyword here. First of all, Gabor needed to give people the
    T-shirts they ordered. Then we had trouble getting the display right with
    the projector. Eventually, we borrowed a laptop from Doron from F5 and
    Shmuel Fomberg was able to start his presentation.
    </p>

    <p>
    Shmuel's talk about Perl/Tk was interesting. It didn't renew too much to me,
    but it was still fun, and sparked some interesting discussions. Then Gabor
    Szabo gave a talk about Perl 6, which from what I understood was a port of his
    Perl 5 course to Perl 6. Several things there sparked a lot of discussion,
    especially the junctions. For example, it turns out that in Perl 6
    "if ((3|4) == 3) { ... }" will execute the condition, but so will
    "if ((3|4) != 3) { ... }". That's because the "|" means "any", and so it
    tests whether any of the operands is equal to 3 or whether any of them
    is not. Another interesting feature is the chained conditionals:
    "if (3 &lt; 7 == 7 &lt; 10 &gt; 8)" will evaluate to true in Perl 6.
    </p>

    <p>
    I left the meeting prematurely along with my ride (Shmuel), so I may have
    missed some more interesting stuff.
    <a href="http://www.szabgab.com/perl6.html">The slides are online</a>,
    however.

    There is no report yet, we are arguing with Yuval what will /foo|foobar/ match.

    Sagiv gave me a lift to the meeting. He invited his cousin who came with
    his friend, and we met them outside. Uri Bruck also came there later on.
    We talked about the fact Actcom (an Israeli ISP) was bought by Bezeq
    Bein-leumi and what it would mean for the Linux support.
    </p>

    <p>
    We then entered F5, reserved our seats in the presentations' room, and
    went to the kitchen to drink and munch on the cookies. More people came,
    and we had some nice socialising.
    </p>

    <p>
    We waited for Gabor to arrive, and he eventually did, he set up his laptop,
    connected it to the video output (worked so-so), and started presenting.
    Gabor prepared the slides as yet-unpublished pages on his blog, and used
    them as a reference. He said he is going to give the presentation on
    the upcoming YAPC::EU in Vienna, but that he doesn't expect a large
    audience, because he was scheduled simulatenously to
    <a href="http://perl.plover.com/">Mark Jason Dominus</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In any case, Gabor talked about how various open source projects deal with
    running automated test periodically and with Quality Assurance. He covered
    perl 5, Parrot, pugs, PostgreSQL, the Linux kernel and (briefly) Mozilla and
    Subversion. It was interesting, but felt a bit unfocused to me, and
    the ad-hoc-ish slides he prepared did not help much. Someone then suggested
    he'll cover the various philosophies instead of going over what
    each project does, but I prefer Gabor's original method.
    </p>

    <p>
    Then Yuval Ya'ari gave the second part of his presentation about regular
    expressions in Perl. He went over the various nodes of the regex engine,
    and covered the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">"trie"</a>
    (pronounced "tree") data structure used to optimise some alternation
    expressions. He then demonstrated the "re" module with its flags, that
    can be used to debug regular expressions and understand how Perl compiled
    them. It was very interesting and engaging.
    </p>

    <p>
    Then, many of us (nine, in fact) went to the Irish Pub after a long time
    where we were too lazy to do so. It was already quite late and we stayed
    in the pub until 23:00. There we discussed whether programmers who are
    good in one technology will write good code in other technologies, on
    version control, on whether it is OK to write quick and dirty code for
    an urgent task, and then to either throw it away, or refactor or rewrite
    it later on.

    <p>
    This time I arrived to the location by using a taxi-cab, because my
    usual ride had a short Milu'im that fell on the meeting date. I met
    other people there, and we spent some time waiting for Yuval Kogman (who
    gave the presentations) to come as he was sick and had to take a cab. But
    he did arrive at the end.
    </p>

    <p>
    Then the logisitics started: Yuval forgot a DVI-to-VGA adaptor so he could
    not connect his Mac laptop to the screen. And Zohar (Kelrich) did not have
    one either. We also could not find a laptop, so we brought a desktop
    computer, connected it to the power, the screen and the Internet, and used
    it to browse the presentations from the Internet. This worked.
    </p>

    <p>
    Yuval gave two presentations:
    <a href="http://www.iinteractive.com/moose/yapc_eu_2007_slides/start.html">one
    about Moose</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.iinteractive.com/moose/object_meta_programming_slides/slides/start.html">one
    about Object Meta-Programming</a>. The Moose one was interesting and we
    also understood part of the Object Meta-Programming one. However, then
    Yuval started talking about "MO" and most of us only vaguely understood
    what he said.
    </p>

    <p>
    We then went to the Irish pub (along with Yuval), and there discussed
    JavaScript, and many other things. I had to leave early, because of
    my ride.
