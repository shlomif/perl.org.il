The most common reasons for rejection are
1) You are sending a message with a From: field which is not subscribed.

   Solution:
   Make sure you send the message from the same e-mail account and that
   your sys-admin does not rewrite your Form field. If you use several e-mail
   accounts for sending but want to receive only one copy of the messages
   of the mailing list you can subscribe all of your outgoing e-mail addresses
   and then set the "Mail delivery" option to "No" on all but one registration.

2) You are sending a message in HTML (or "Rich") format while our mailing list
   is configured to reject most of the attachments. In particular when you
   send HTML messages they are actually attachments.

   Solution:
   Send plain text messages and send your code examples in-line.
   Even in Outlook (Express)? you have an option to decide on a per-mail
   basis if you'd like to send plain text or HTML ("Rich text" they call it)
