    Invitation to the upcoming meetings of the Israeli Perl Mongers


                  In the organization of the 
          Israeli Perl Mongers http://www.perl.org.il/
                             and 
          Perl Training Israel http://www.pti.co.il/

we would like to announce the schedule of the coming 3 meetings.

The Israeli Perl Users Group (Israel.pm) was established in April 2001.
Since March 2002 we organize monthly meetings with technical presentations
in various aspects of the Perl Programming language and discussion.

In the previous month we started a serious of presentations under the
title "Foreign Languages". We belive that learning about other programming
languages will improve our capability to use Perl as well. In addition
we keep the usual Perl related presentations.

Our meetings take place place once a month on thursday evenings 
between 18:00-22:00 in the offices of Dapey Zahav http://www.d.co.il/
in Aba Hilel Str. 23. Ramat Gan.

Dec 11  Shlomo Yona: The garbage collector of Perl (40 minutes)

          called the Garbage collector.
